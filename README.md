# SymPIC
The symplectic structure preserving particle-in-cell (PIC) code is 
designed for long-term simulations of the Vlasov-Maxwell system. It 
exactly preserves the symplectic two-form associated with the discrete 
Hamiltonian Vlasov-Maxwell equation and in most cases numeric errors 
of invariants such as the total energy and momentum will be bounded within
a small value during the whole simulation.

This is a MPI and OpenMP implemention of the parallel explicit 
2nd-order charge conservative non-canonical symplectic PIC scheme 
introduced in Ref. [1] and the 1st-order relativistic charge 
conservative symplectic PIC scheme in Ref. [2]. Some codes are compiled
for x86-64 machines. Most c files are generated by a scheme-like lisp 
dialect PSCMC designed for multi-platform parallel programmings. Source 
code will be opened in the near future.

In this program, uthash.h (http://troydhanson.github.com/uthash/) is 
used.

To build the program, run the following command:

./compile.sh

We have only tested the clang5.0/6.0, gcc-7.3.1 and icc-11 compiler.

Configuration files are executable scheme (a dialect of lisp) codes. To run
the example, 

cd example

STDLIB=../stdlib.scm mpirun -n 4 ../sympic x_ebw.ss

After it exits, three files (tmpEB tmpEN and tmpJ) will be generated. 
These files are in the GAPS-IO format. We can use the matplotlib (ipython) to 
show the spectrum of the extraordinary and electron Bernstein wave.

execfile("../cgapsio/pygapsio.py")

Ey_field=reshape(GAPS_IO_Load("tmpEB"),[512,2,512,3])[:,0,:,1]

contour(abs(fftn(Ey_field))[:60,:256])

The tmpEB file stores the electromagnetic fields, its shape
is 2Nt * Nz * Ny * Nx * 3, where for 0, 2, 4, ... time step the 
electric field is stored, and for 1, 3, 5, ... time step the 
magnetic field is stored. The tmpEN file stores some particle
informations, currently its shape is Nt * Nz * Ny * Nx * (7NUM_SPEC), 
where 7 components are 

\sum_{p \in grid} [m_i vx_p^2/2,m_i vy_p^2/2,m_i vz_p^2/2, vx_p, vy_p, vz_p, 1].

There is also a GUI based on Tkinter(python2) for generating and 
modifying the configuration files, it is located at gui/gui.py

cd gui

export STDLIB=../stdlib.scm

python2 gui.py
