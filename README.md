# SymPIC
The symplectic structure preserving particle-in-cell (PIC) code is 
designed for long-term simulations of the Vlasov-Maxwell system. It 
exactly preserves the symplectic two-form associated with the discrete 
Hamiltonian Vlasov-Maxwell equation and in most cases numeric errors 
invariants such as the total energy and momentum will be bounded within a 
small value.

This is a precompiled x86-64 binary MPI implement of the explicit 2nd-order 
non-canonical symplectic PIC scheme introduced in Ref. [1]. Source code
will be opened in the future.
