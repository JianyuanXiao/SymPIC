List of Changes in SymPIC 0.3.0

* Add New explicit 2nd-order charge conservative symplectic non-relativistic PIC scheme in the cylindrical mesh (can be used by setting USE_TORI in the configuration file to 1, R_0 is specified by the TORI_X0 variable)
* Add New Multi-step sort Feature for explicit 2nd-order charge conservative symplectic PIC scheme in the cylindrical mesh (can be used by setting NUM_MULTI_STEP_SORT in the configuration file)
* Add New locally implicit charge conservative symplectic relativistic PIC scheme in slab and cylindrical meshes (can be used by setting USE_REL in the configuration file to 1)
* Now particles can be initialized by using the user_defined_particle_distribution function in user_defined_particle_distribution.c (USE_USER_DEFINED_PARTICLE_DISTRIBUTION in the configuration file should be set to 1 in this case)

List of Changes in SymPIC 0.1.3

* Add support on all unix-like systems

List of Changes in SymPIC 0.1.2

* Add support on Windows systems with cygwin 

List of Changes in SymPIC 0.1.1

* Fix a PML field initialization bug

* Fix the G field iteration bug


List of Changes in SymPIC 0.1.0

* New lost-cone distribution function for particles is available (can be used by seting USE_LOST_CONE_DIST, LOST_CONE_MU0, and LOST_CONE_DELTA variables). 

* New Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) absorbing boundary support (can be used by seting USE_PML_ABC_DIR, PML_LEVEL, and PML_SIGMA_MAX variables).

* Fix the gcc loop optimization bug, now the SymPIC can be compiled with gcc -O3.

* Now it can output particle locations and velocities (Experimental).
